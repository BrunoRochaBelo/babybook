# @babybook/landingpage (Landing Page Baby Book)

This is a code bundle for Landing Page Baby Book. The original project is available at https://www.figma.com/design/fH5g8BFZyH5BX2fxnkJgCG/Landing-Page-Baby-Book.

## Running the code

Run `pnpm install` to install the dependencies (from the repo root).

Run `pnpm run dev:landig` from the repository root to start the landing page development server. By default the Vite dev server runs on port `3001` (if taken, Vite will try the next free port).
